## Bugs

- interval does not get cleared on disconnect, possible bug?

  - probably not, if teacher accidentally disconnects, we would want the room to remain in case they come back

- when creating question when only 1 multiple choice is shown and filled, send question is enabled,
  needs to be greater than 2
