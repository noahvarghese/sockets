## Bugs

- interval does not get cleared on disconnect, possible bug?

  - probably not, if teacher accidentally disconnects, we would want the room to remain in case they come back

- name does not get deleted on diconnect

- server checking if question is correct is incorrect

- error on frontend when auto-submitting when time runs out
